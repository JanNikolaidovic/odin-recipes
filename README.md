# odin-recipes

This is my first attempt at creating a website solely using HTML, as part of The Odin Projectâ€™s fundamentals course. Through this project, I learned how to add titles, apply basic text formatting, create ordered and unordered lists, and incorporate both absolute and relative links, as well as images.
