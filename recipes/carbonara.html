    <h2>What is Spaghetti alla Carbonara?</h2>

    <p>Carbonara is a <i>Roman</i> dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta. </p>
    <p>The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot enough to cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oil</strong>: This traditional Italian recipe starts with olive oil. </li>
            <li><strong>Guanciale</strong>: Buy guanciale (or cured pork cheek) at your local butcher. If you canâ€™t find it, you can substitute unsmoked bacon or pancetta.</li>
            <li><strong>Spaghetti</strong>: Use store-bought or <a href="./homemade-pasta.html">homemade pasta noodles</a>. If you like, you can substitute bucatini for the spaghetti. </li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Three large eggs add richness and flavor. </li>
            <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: Opt for hand-shredded Pecorino Romano cheese. You can substitute Parmesan, if preferred.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: This flavorful spaghetti alla carbonara is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pork in olive oil until browned and crispy, then drain on paper towels. </li>
            <li>Boil the spaghetti in salted water. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool.</li>
            <li>Whisk the eggs, 1/2 of the cheese, and some pepper in a bowl until smooth. </li>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy. </li>
            <li>Stir in the pork, then top with the remaining cheese and more black pepper.</li>           
        </ol>
    <h3>Notes and tips from the chef:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ask somebody to hold the pot so you can stir pasta quickly while pouring the egg mixture over it.</li>
            <li>Please note the addition of reserved pasta water when using the magazine version of this recipe.</li>
        </ul>
